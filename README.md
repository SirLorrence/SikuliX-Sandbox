# SikuliX-Sandbox

Command to Run: 
```
java -jar .\sikulixidewin-2.0.6-20220817.114540-15.jar -r .\MetalSlugTest.py
```

Notes:
- What i found out was that running through the IDE for the first time will result in smooth run, but sequential runs after that 'keyDown' command would not work. Temporary work around is to run the full command through the terminal
- After running the automation, for some reason it doesn't return the keyboard input right away....its annoying
- keyDown input doesn't show in the log output
